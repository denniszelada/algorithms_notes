An analogy for an array is, a seats of a cinema, on an array all the known people (you and your friends seat together), and on a linked list the known people is seated on different places but someone knows where they are seated.

### Benefits of an array

* Read, because you know the address for every item of the array.

### Tradeoffs of arrays

* Inserting on the midddle, you need to switch everything on the side

### Benefits of a Linked List

* Inserts, because you don't have to reserve the memory and you can store the information on any position.
* Insert in the middle becuase you can just change de points of the element

### Tradeoffs of linked list

* If you wan to read an element on any position you need to know the address of that specific element.
